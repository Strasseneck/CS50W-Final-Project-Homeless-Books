# CS50W-Final-Project-Homeless-Books

This project marks the culmination of my second CS50 course, an application for a book-selling business. It's primary goal is to streamline book listings and efficiently manage the inventory.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Developed using Django, providing a robust foundation.
- **Frontend:** Utilizes JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap for a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- Integration with Google Books API for automated book information retrieval and form population.
- I've utilized the [Abebooks Rest API](https://github.com/ravila4/abebooks) to retrieve Abebooks price info and wrap it in a custom Class for rendering.
- Custom web scraping module leveraging Beautiful Soup to scrape Booklooker for pricing and book information.
- Dynamic and easy to understand user interface for sorting and interacting with the seller's inventory of books.
- Custom dark theme and look use Css and Bootstrap based on the client's preferences.

Got to take a break because of doing Codeworks course, so here's a few pics of the current look and design. I'll do a video when I have a chance.
