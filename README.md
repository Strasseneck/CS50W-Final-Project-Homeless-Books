Homeless Books is a custom bookseller inventory management web application that features a market check price scraping feature. This feature utilizes a custom Abebooks module along with two additional custom web scraping modules employing Beautiful Soup. These modules are designed to scrape specific platforms for book pricing information.

Homeless Books manages images using Pillow and retrieves book data to automate the listing process by utilizing the Google Books API. It then generates a book description based on both the returned data and inputted information.
